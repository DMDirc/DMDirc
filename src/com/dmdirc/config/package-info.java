/**
 * Deals with client configuration and preferences.
 *
 * DMDirc's configuration system is based upon a set of 'identities'. Each
 * identity has a specific target which controls which elements of the client
 * it is applied to. Identities can be targetted to the client as a whole,
 * and individual networks, servers or channels. Identities may also specify
 * an order, which controls in which order they are checked when looking up
 * a configuration setting.
 *
 * Most of the time configuration settings need to be sourced from multiple
 * identities. For example, channel settings will come from the channel's
 * identities if any exist and if any contain the setting in question. Failing
 * that, they will come from the server's identities, then the network's, and
 * finally the global identities. This ordering and lookup behaviour is
 * captured in the {@link ConfigManager} class, which can determine which
 * identities should be used in a specific context and then use those to
 * look up settings appropriately.
 *
 * Identities are all stored on disk under the 'identities' directory in the
 * user's DMDirc profile. Default identities in this package are extracted
 * automatically by the {@link IdentityManager} if they do not exist.
 * Identities use the DMDirc {@link com.dmdirc.util.io.ConfigFile} file format.
