DMDirc is a new cross platform IRC client written in java, it is being developed under the MIT licence by
     <a href="http://www.md87.co.uk" title="MD87">Chris 'MD87' Smith</a>, <a href="http://www.greboid.com" title="Greboid">
     Greg 'Greboid' Holmes</a> and <a href="http://home.dataforce.org.uk" title="Dataforce">Shane 'Dataforce' Mc Cormack</a>.
     <p>DMDirc was started to address the lack of a good IRC client for Linux, it can however be run on any java capable platform, 
     including OS X, Windows, BSD and (Open)Solaris. While there are plenty of reasonable clients, 
     most are lacking in one respect or another. We hope that DMDirc will fill this gap.
